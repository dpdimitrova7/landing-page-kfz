The group who trains at the club from the seniors to the newcomers are all good people with good values, humility, respect, hard work amongst other attributes. Coming here has honestly changed my life in a really positive way, I would recommend this to anyone, so what are you waiting for?",

This Kung Fu system is interesting to learn and practice, with endless possibilities, which motivate to learn more and more. The instructor is knowledgeable, supportive and makes sure you're always progressing. Since the first class, I felt part of an amazing group of people training in a positive atmosphere...",

I always feel great after each class and take away something different each time whether it be about kung fu fitness or kung fu philosophy. Plus the other students are great to train alongside and it's just a great supportive atmosphere. Exactly what I was looking for :)",

I've been training at this club since it started and each class gives me a great work out, both physically and mentally. A great mix of self defence knowledge and traditional Chinese Kung Fu. Everyone in the class is a joy to train with, always helpful and friendly and the instructor is extremely knowledgeable and always willing to share that knowledge...",

      review: "This is an amazing place to learn this kung fu system.I think the best days of the week are when I get there, it makes my body/spirit feel so good and I just want to learn more and more each time. As a novice, I recommend the Tai Qi lessons as well, they complete the kung fu lessons in that you get to know and feel your own body better. Great instructor, and I just love the spirit of the lessons.",
